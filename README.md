#Github and git assignment 
## I've learnt about git and github 
This is my first GitHub work.
I learned from this video 
 I learned that git add tells Git which changes I want to include in the next commit
 I learned that git commit saves the staged changes permanently in the repository
 i learned that branches allow working on different versions of a project without affecting the main code.
